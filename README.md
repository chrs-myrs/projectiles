projectiles.js
--------------

### Overview

projectiles.js is a pure JavaScript demo that will create a projectile 
every time you click the mouse in the browser window.  Each projectile
will have a random colour, angle and speed. 

### Example

[http://myrs.uk/examples/projectiles.html](http://myrs.uk/examples/projectiles.html)

### Testing

The root index.html can be used to inspect the code.

Once built the output can be viewed at dist/index.html.

### Build

Build automation using gulp.js in npm.  

To install the package and build the following needs to be run.

```bash
> npm install
> gulp
```

This will also start a process to watch for changes in either source file
and recompile.
