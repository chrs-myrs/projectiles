### Testing

The root index.html can be used to inspect the code.

Once built the output can be viewed at dist/index.html.

### Build

Build automation using gulp.js in npm.  

To install the package and build the following needs to be run.

```bash
> npm install
> gulp
```

This will also start a process to watch for changes in either source file and recompile.
